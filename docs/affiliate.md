# Affiliate Program

Our affiliate program allows you to earn rewards for referring new customers to Pirsch.

## How Does It Work?

Every time someone signs up through your affiliate link and becomes a paying customer, you'll receive a reward. The reward will be added to your account balance and used to reduce the amount on your next invoice.

To copy your affiliate link, sign in and click on your account (top right corner). Copy the link that appears at the top and send it to someone to sign up.

Once the link is clicked, the sign-up will be associated with your account for up to 72 hours. After that, it will count as a regular sign-up and you will not receive any commission. The visitor can click your link again to make sure it is associated with your account.

## How Much Can I Earn?

The reward depends on the subscription fee of the customer you brought to Pirsch. For monthly subscriptions, it will be the monthly fee (for example, $6 for 10,000 page views). For annual subscriptions, it's double the monthly fee ($60/12*2 = $10 for 10,000 page views, for example). The amount will be added to your balance once. Taxes are not included.

## Who Can Participate in the Affiliate Program?

Anyone with an active Pirsch subscription can participate in the affiliate program.

## Can I Withdraw the Balance?

No, sorry. For various reasons (mostly tax-related), we don't make payouts. Any remaining balance upon cancellation will be forfeited.
