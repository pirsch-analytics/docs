# Exporting Statistics

Since you have full ownership of your data, you can export the statistics at any time.

## CSV Export

To export your aggregated statistics as CSV files, go to the **Import / Export** Settings page. Click on **Export data to CSV** and select the period and data you want to export. Depending on the amount of data you're exporting, the download may take a while.

## Other Exports

For larger exports, please [contact support](mailto:support@pirsch.io). We offer raw data exports and custom formats upon request.
